# blockchain

This is my default repo for storing and testing working scripts related to the Etherium mainframe.
This script fetches the current price of "eth" and returns it to the console in $ USD.
Paste yor etherscan api key in the eth_price.js script , clone repo, navigate to folder and run;

command : node eth_price.js

you need to be in an environment with node.js installed and npm.

This script can be used as a module in larger projects or on it's own.

After running the command you will see a response similar to the one below ;

 node eth_price.js
Current ETH price: 2071.22
